## What is tldr-pages?

The **tldr-pages** project is a collection of community-maintained help pages
for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement
to traditional [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page).

Maybe you are new to the command-line world? Or just a little rusty?
Or perhaps you can't always remember the arguments to `lsof`, or `tar`?

It certainly doesn't help that the first option explained in `man tar` is:

```
-b blocksize
   Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.
   As a rule, this argument is only needed when reading from or writing to tape drives,
   and usually not even then as the default block size of 20 records (10240 bytes) is very common.
```

There seems to be room for simpler help pages, focused on practical examples.
How about:
